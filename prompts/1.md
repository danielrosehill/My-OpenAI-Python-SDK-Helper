The attached file contains a description of the functionality of the latest version of the Python SDK by Open AI. 

Your task is to reformat this as a piece of contextual data for a large language model assistant whose task is to provide scripts which are compliant with the latest version of the SDK. 

The text should be reformatted using the following directions:

- Remove all extraneous text that does not directly describe the functionality of the SDK. 
- Reformat the text for machine readability but use markdown as the output format.
- Make any improvements you deem necessary to the coherent and organization of the source data. 

Include today's date as a parameter towards the header of the formatted text.  

Return the formatted text within a code block. 

All functions described in the input document must be included in the context document generated. Do not omit any.
